Some people collect hobbies, others weird obsessions, I seem to find myself collecting broken systems to fix, and when that frustration stuck around, I decided to make a career out of it in UX. Turns out, once you make a career out of simplifying chaos, the universe has a way of pointing you at the next mess to fix, so my leadership style ended up pragmatic. No fluff, no corpo speak, just backing the team to execute and deliver a banger product.

When I’m not working, I’m usually hashing out 3D prints, prompting otherworldly generative art, vibe-coding side projects, casual gaming, or trying to keep an indoor garden alive at my condo.
