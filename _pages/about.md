Some people collect hobbies, others weird obsessions, I seem to find myself collecting broken systems to fix, and when that frustration stuck around, I decided to make a career out of it in UX. Turns out, once you make a career out of simplifying chaos, the universe has a way of pointing you at the next mess to fix, so my leadership style ended up pragmatic. No fluff, no corpo speak, just backing the team to execute and deliver a banger product. After 15 years in the industry I’ve learned that the best results come from cutting through noise, empowering your team, and keeping users at the center of every decision.

When I’m not working, I’m usually hashing out 3D prints, prompting otherworldly generative art, vibe-coding side projects, casual gaming, or trying to keep my indoor garden alive and thriving.
